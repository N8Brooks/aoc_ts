Advent of Code solutions for year 2016.

## Object Oriented Style Path Finding

[Day 11](https://github.com/N8Brooks/deno_aoc/blob/main/year_2016/day_11.ts).
Involved finding the shortest path between floors where you can carry up to two
items at a time. Certain other criteria apply. Since this is an unweighted graph
a breadth first search is sufficient for the search space.

## Slowest Problem

[Day 4](https://github.com/N8Brooks/deno_aoc/blob/main/year_2015/day_04.ts).
This is a mock bitcoin implementation where you have to find a hash with certain
criteria. Similar to year 2015 the slowest problem involved MD5 hashes.
